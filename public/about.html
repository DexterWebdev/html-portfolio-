<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dexter P. Galenzoga, and I am 28-year-old native of the municipality of Maluso in the provinve of Basilan. 
  I was born December 5,1997, in Barangay Townsite, where I spent my formative years before eventually relocating to my current residence in Canduman, Mandaue, Cebu.
  I am happily married to my beautiful wife, Donna, who remains my constant source of inspiration and support.</p>

<p>​Professionally, I serve as a dedicated sailor within the Armed Forces of the Philippines, specifically member of the Philippine Navy.
   I am currently assigned at the 1st Naval Combat Engineering Battalion under the Naval Combat Engineering Brigade (Seabees).
  My journey in the military began nearly a decade ago when I entered the service on July 13, 2016.
  As I celebrate my 10th year of active duty this year, I look forward to continuing my commitment to the flag, 
  with the ultimate goal of completing a full and honorable career of 20 to 25 years before entering retirement.</p>

<p>Looking toward the future, I remain steadfast in my goal to serve the country with honor and distinction for a total of 20 to 25 years. 
  This journey is not merely about reaching a retirement milestone, but about building a legacy of discipline and service that my family can be proud of. 
  As I navigate the challenges and responsibilities of being a "Seabee," I am driven by the desire to provide a stable and prosperous future for my wife, Donna,
  while continuing to contribute to the peace and progress of the Philippines through my specialized role in the Naval Combat Engineering community.</p>
